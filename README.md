## <font face="Times New Roman" color=black size=6>Section 1. A brief introduction to JoyMem</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">It is well known that common users tend to reuse personally identifiable information and old passwords to construct new passwords, rendering their accounts at high risks. Password managers can manage and generate passwords with high security and poor usability, with disadvantages such as security holes, design flaws, and low penetration rates. Besides, most of the previous **password generation mechanisms (PGMs)** don’t comprehensively consider security and usability and give sufficient proof. To get out of the above dilemmas, we propose **a new PGM called JoyMem ensuring the sufficient security and good usability of the generated passwords.** Unlike most existing PGMs that were only used in a single language, JoyMem has excellent scalability and can be deployed to websites or applications of different languages or services. In this project, we give **detailed generalized implementations of JoyMem in Chinese and English**, and an analysis of the usability of the generated password, **not for a certain service to simplify the problem**. In future research, we will give implementations of JoyMem under specific important services. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">To improve the memorability of the generated passwords, we first analyze the real-world password datasets to observe users’ habits of constructing passwords. We find that user-constructed passwords have an **Interleaved Security Structure (ISS)**, i.e., high-security fields and low-security fields are arranged alternately, and a high-security field and a subsequent low-security field form an interleaved layer, and vice versa. User-constructed passwords have fewer interleaved layers (usually 0.5 layer) and high-security fields (usually 0). So we make the passwords generated by JoyMem satisfy ISS, with more interleaved layers (1∼4.5 layers) and high-security fields (1∼6). The generated passwords also retain other characteristics of the real-world passwords, such as character composition and field semantics. To resist targeted attacking using sensitive personal information, inspired by human memory laws, we design a Q&A mechanism to collect users’ insensitive **Type-3 personal information** we define, which forms the mnemonic fields of the passwords after processing. It is worth noting that the above Q&A design can guarantee the probability regression of the question selection and the uniform distribution of the answer space. And the guessability of the generated passwords will not increase after JoyMem runs for a period of time. </font>


## <font face="Times New Roman" color=black size=6>Section 2. Design of the usability experiment of JoyMem</font>
#### <font face="Times New Roman">**▶ The usability experiment includes the following two phases:**</font> 

#### <font face="Times New Roman">●  Phase 1.</font>
<font face="Times New Roman">

***- Collection of demographic information.*** The webpage displays “Imagine you are registering an e-commerce account, please follow the system prompts and remember the generated password”. A participant shall fill in her email, gender, age, highest degree and occupation (whether she is an information security practitioner).

***- Password generation.*** A participant selects the desired password length (8~20) and questions, and answers the questions. Next, JoyMem generates a password and displays it with the understandable password annotation on the webpage. 

***- Memory training.*** A participant is required to enter the password correctly 3 times to end memory training. When the participant forgets the password, she can click the button on the webpage to view the password, and then she is required to re-enter the password correctly 3 times.

***- Memory interference.*** A participant is asked to watch a 3-minute video.

***- Short-term recall.*** A participant is asked to enter the password correctly within 5 attempts. Otherwise, she is believed to forget the password.

***- Questionnaire 1.*** The questionnaire asks the participant whether she records the password. If she does not forget the password in Short-term recall of Phase 1, after 48 hours, she will be invited to participate in Phase 2. In particular, for an English participant, we will assign a corresponding survey code, which is her voucher for getting rewards for Phase 1 on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and participating in Phase 2 of the usability experiment.</font>





#### <font face="Times New Roman">●  Phase 2.</font>
<font face="Times New Roman">

***- Verification of demographic information.*** A participant shall fill in the same personal information as in Phase 1 before passing the identity authentication of Phase 2. An English participant shall fill in an additional survey code. 

***- Long-term recall.*** Similar to Short-term recall of Phase 1, a participant is asked to enter the password correctly within 5 attempts. Otherwise, she is believed to forget the password. 

***- Questionnaire 2.*** The questionnaire asks the participant whether she records the password. Specially, for an English participant, we will assign her a new survey code, which is the voucher for her to receive the remuneration of Phase 2.

## <font face="Times New Roman" color=black size=6>Section 3.  Demonstration videos of the usability experiment of JoyMem</font>

Due to high maintenance costs, we closed the experimental platform after completing the usability experiment. However, to give readers an intuitive impression, we provide several **demonstration videos** of the usability experiment of JoyMem in Chinese and English scenarios. We choose 8 and 12 as the representative password lengths, corresponding to 2 and 3 questions that need to be answered respectively. 

#### **▶ The video list is as follows:**

a)	Chinese scene: password length = 8, and a user can remember the password effortlessly

[Phase 2: https://youtu.be/ofCIvZ-pwhs](https://youtu.be/ofCIvZ-pwhs)

b)	Chinese scene: password length = 12, and a user can remember the password through memory training

## <font face="Times New Roman" color=black size=6>Section 4.  Experimental results of the usability experiment of JoyMem</font>
<font face="Times New Roman">
To evaluate the usability of the passwords generated by JoyMem, we invite 394 participants online, including 252 Chinese-speaking participants and 142 English-speaking participants. For Chinese participants, we send emails containing the purpose, process and links of the experiment to invite native Chinese speakers. For English participants, we recruit native English speakers through Mturk crowdsourcing service. The demographic information is shown in Table I. The results show that, the ratios of male to female for both Chinese and English participants are close to 1:1, which conforms to the real-world situation. Participants aged 18∼34 account for a large proportion (Chinese: 88:49%, English: 77:46%). They are more familiar with the Internet and passwords, and have a more positive attitude towards questions.

The usability experimental results of JoyMem and the leading PGMs are shown in Table II. The results show that, the passwords generated by JoyMem have good usability. A user does not have to spend too much time and effort to create the password, and can easily remember it.
